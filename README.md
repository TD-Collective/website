# Timedrift Collective Website

This repository contains the static website for **Timedrift Collective**, a program that helps solo game developers build and launch their own titles. The pages here describe the collective, how to apply, job openings, and related information.

## Previewing Locally

No build tools are required. Run the provided script to start a local web server (requires Python 3):

```bash
./serve.sh
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser to view the site. Unknown routes will display `404.html`.

## Prerequisites & Optional Tools

- **Required:** [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (only for running the local preview server)
- **Optional:** formatters or linters such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for HTML/CSS/JS or [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript. These tools are not required but help maintain consistent code style.

Feel free to contribute fixes or improvements by opening a pull request.
