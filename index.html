    <h2>About Timedrift</h2>
    <h3>A Studio Built Around You</h3>
    <p>Most studios revolve around teams. We’re building a studio around individual creators.</p>
    <p>Timedrift is a new kind of game studio for a new kind of developer — one who works fast, stays small, and builds smart using modern AI tools. We don’t invest in game pitches. We hire the people who can lead them.</p>
    <p>When you join Timedrift, you become the Game Director of your own project. You’ll work full-time — with salary, benefits, and vision control — while we support you in shaping and shipping the game you want to make.</p>
    <p>You’d be doing the work anyway. Now you’ll get the structure and support to go further, faster.</p>

        <h3>Get Hired Full-Time</h3>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Shape the Vision</h3>
        <p>You’ll define the game you want to build — with collaborative support from us to shape, scope, and validate it along the way.</p>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Build with Modern Tools</h3>
        <p>Use AI, off-the-shelf systems, and streamlined workflows to move quickly and execute with focus and autonomy.</p>

        <h3>Ship and Share the Win</h3>
        <p>Most games aim to launch in 9–12 months. When yours ships, we share in the outcome — including the revenue it earns.</p>

  <!-- Who We're Hiring Section -->
  <section class="content-section container fade-in-section">
    <h2>Who We’re Hiring</h2>
    <h3>You Own the Work — and the Vision</h3>
    <p>We’re looking for creators who are ready to take the lead — not just build a game, but direct one entirely on their own, with our light-touch support behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>You might be a fit if:</p>
    <ul class="centered-list">
        <li>You’ve shipped something on your own — a prototype, game jam entry, or commercial title.</li>
        <li>You want to stay small, work fast, and focus deeply.</li>
        <li>You’re comfortable taking responsibility for both vision and execution.</li>
        <li>You view AI as a force multiplier that gives you superpowers.</li>
        <li>You’re ready to work full-time and go all in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not sure if you're a perfect fit? Reach out anyway. Some of the best collaborations start with a simple conversation.</p>

  <!-- Support Roles Section -->
  <section class="content-section container fade-in-section">
    <h2>Support Roles</h2>
    <h3>Help Solo Creators Move Fast</h3>
    <p>Timedrift isn’t built around traditional departments — but we do hire experienced devs to support solo creators behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>If you’ve shipped games and know how to support others without taking over, you might be a fit for our creative support team. These roles help solo creators sustain momentum — assisting with polish, testing, content tuning, and anything else that lets the game ship strong.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is this freelance or a job?</h3>
      <p>Full-time employment. You’ll be on payroll, with benefits, working as the Game Director of your own title.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do I need a complete game idea to apply?</h3>
      <p>No. We’re hiring people, not pitches. We’ll shape the right game together once you’re onboard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What happens if the project fails or needs to pivot?</h3>
      <p>No penalties. We work together to restart or evolve the idea. You’re still salaried and supported.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How long do I get to build?</h3>
      <p>We aim to ship in 9–12 months, but timelines flex based on scope and quality. The goal is to finish — not flounder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What’s the pay like?</h3>
      <p>We offer competitive salary, benefits, and revenue share. It’s not a freelance gig or a profit-share-only promise — it’s a real job.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How selective is this?</h3>
      <p>We’re looking for strong solo builders, but we’re not trying to be exclusive for its own sake. If you’ve got execution chops and a strong perspective, we want to talk.</p>
